At XtraFit, bodybuilding is more than just building muscle — it's about building discipline, confidence, and an unbeatable mindset. Our gym has been home to many aspiring bodybuilders, some of whom have gone on to compete at state and national levels, including Mr. Gujarat, where our members have earned top rankings.

We offer over 100+ advanced equipment designed for strength and hypertrophy training, targeting every major and minor muscle group. From Olympic barbells to isolation machines, every tool is available to sculpt the physique you dream of.

But great bodies are not built with machines alone — they’re built with knowledge and the right strategy. Our certified trainers design customized bodybuilding routines, periodized plans, and muscle-specific splits based on your body type, experience level, and goals. Whether you’re in the bulking or cutting phase, we’ll ensure your workouts and recovery are aligned for maximum gains.

We also educate our members about supplementation, nutrition basics, and injury prevention — because your growth depends on more than just lifting weights. Steam baths, massage therapies, and recovery protocols are available to support muscle repair and reduce fatigue.

Our facility includes a wide range of resistance machines, free weights, and functional training tools that allow you to train every muscle group effectively. Our trainers help you master form, progressively overload your workouts, and structure balanced programs that avoid overtraining or injury.

While most people focus on losing weight, gaining weight — the healthy way — is just as challenging and important. At XtraFit, we help individuals who struggle with being underweight, low energy, or lean muscle mass to gain healthy weight, not fat.

Our trainers build structured plans that focus on strength training, progressive overload, and hypertrophy to promote muscle gain, not just increase body weight. We pair your workout routine with basic nutrition tips — like how to eat calorie-dense but nutritious food, increase meal frequency, and balance macronutrients for muscle growth.

Many members who once struggled with body image due to being too skinny now enjoy strong, confident physiques thanks to our science-backed approach. The goal is not only to look bigger but to feel stronger, have better stamina, and increase overall physical capability.

With personalized attention, regular assessments, and our fitness tracking app, your weight gain journey is monitored and adapted to keep results coming. Plus, recovery tools like steam therapy and massages help your muscles relax and grow after intense sessions.

If you're tired of being overlooked in fitness conversations and want to build a healthy, attractive body the right way — XtraFit is here to transform your goals into results.

We blend traditional techniques with modern innovations. From strength circuits and functional workouts to HIIT, floor exercises, and equipment-based training — you’ll never be bored or plateau. We track your progress using our app, so you stay consistent, accountable, and inspired.

More importantly, we focus on building habits, not temporary changes. Real training also means respecting recovery — we provide tools like massage chairs, steam baths, and stretching routines to protect your body while it grows stronger.

1. Cardio (Metabolic Conditioning)

At XtraFit, we believe cardio should do more than just make you sweat — it should transform your energy levels, burn stubborn fat, and boost your metabolism for long-term results. That’s why we focus on Metabolic Conditioning, a smart approach to cardio that combines intensity with strategy.

Metabolic conditioning (or MetCon) includes high-energy workouts like circuits, intervals, and HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) designed to keep your heart rate elevated and your metabolism revved up long after your workout ends. These routines don’t just burn calories — they improve how efficiently your body uses energy throughout the day.

Whether you’re a beginner or an advanced athlete, our trainers at XtraFit guide you through dynamic cardio sessions tailored to your fitness level. We use a mix of treadmills, cycles, rowing machines, battle ropes, jump boxes, and bodyweight moves to keep your sessions exciting and result-oriented.

MetCon is ideal for fat loss, endurance building, and enhancing overall athletic performance. It’s also time-efficient — giving you maximum benefit in less time. Plus, our app-based progress tracking lets you monitor your improvement in endurance, speed, and recovery.

With our spacious cardio zone and motivating atmosphere, you'll enjoy every session while working toward your fitness goals. Whether you're aiming to lose weight, improve stamina, or simply feel more energized throughout the day, Metabolic Conditioning at XtraFit is your answer.
2. Stretching


3. Aerobics

Looking for a fun, energetic way to burn calories, improve heart health, and boost your mood? Aerobics at XtraFit combines music, movement, and motivation to deliver a full-body cardio workout that keeps you coming back for more.

Our aerobics classes are led by certified instructors who bring enthusiasm, creativity, and variety to each session. Whether it’s Zumba-style dance routines, step aerobics, or functional cardio workouts, every class is designed to improve cardiovascular endurance, burn fat, and tone muscles — all while having fun.

Aerobics is a great option for people of all ages and fitness levels. The rhythmic movements improve coordination, strengthen the heart, and elevate your metabolism, helping with weight loss and stamina. It’s especially popular among members who enjoy group settings, upbeat music, and social interaction.

At XtraFit, we offer both beginner and advanced aerobics sessions in a spacious, air-conditioned group studio. The classes also improve lung capacity, lower blood pressure, and help with stress relief — making it a complete mind-body workout. And because it's low-impact, aerobics is joint-friendly and ideal for long-term health maintenance.

What makes our aerobics program unique is the community spirit — you’ll laugh, dance, sweat, and feel more alive than ever. Regular participation leads to visible toning in the arms, legs, and core while enhancing energy and mood.

Join the movement at XtraFit and turn your cardio routine into a celebration of fitness!
4. Personal Training

At XtraFit, personal training means personalized transformation. Whether you’re a fitness newbie or an advanced athlete, our certified personal trainers work closely with you to create a custom fitness roadmap that fits your body, your goals, and your lifestyle.

Your journey begins with a detailed fitness assessment — covering body composition, endurance, strength, and flexibility. From there, your trainer crafts a plan tailored to your individual needs, whether it's weight loss, muscle gain, toning, strength building, or post-injury recovery.

Personal training at XtraFit is about more than reps and sets — it’s about accountability, motivation, and consistency. Your trainer ensures proper form, adjusts routines as you progress, and helps you overcome plateaus. With personalized guidance, you avoid injuries, maximize results, and stay on track.

Each session is focused and efficient, saving you time while accelerating your results. Our app-based system allows you to track workouts, communicate with your trainer, and monitor improvements over time.

Beyond the gym floor, our trainers also offer insights on diet, sleep, and recovery to support a 360-degree approach to fitness. Whether you prefer 1-on-1 sessions or small group training, our personal training programs offer flexibility and support that fits your schedule.

At XtraFit, your goals become our mission. If you want serious results, customized attention, and expert coaching — personal training is the way to go.
5. Floor Exercises

Floor exercises form the foundation of functional fitness, and at XtraFit, we emphasize their importance in building strength, stability, and mobility. Using just your body weight or minimal equipment like resistance bands and mats, floor exercises help activate deep muscle groups and improve core strength.

Our trainers incorporate exercises such as planks, crunches, bridges, push-ups, and lunges to improve endurance, coordination, and balance. These routines are ideal for all fitness levels — whether you're just starting or looking to add variety to your advanced training.

Floor workouts offer flexibility in both space and style. You can perform them anywhere in the gym or even at home using our app-based workout plans. These exercises engage multiple muscle groups at once, improve posture, and support weight loss by keeping your body constantly moving and working.

Unlike heavy machine-based workouts, floor training improves real-life functional strength, making everyday movements like lifting, bending, and twisting easier and safer. They're also joint-friendly and excellent for rehabilitation and mobility training.

We offer group floor sessions, personal coaching, and guided video routines — all focused on form and progressive intensity. Combining floor workouts with other gym programs enhances total body fitness and keeps your routine fresh.

At XtraFit, we believe that you don’t need heavy weights to get strong — you need the right moves, the right technique, and the right motivation. Join us and experience the power of floor-based fitness.
6. Strength Training

Strength training is one of the most effective ways to build muscle, burn fat, and improve overall health — and XtraFit is the ultimate destination to unleash your strength potential. Whether you're a beginner or a pro, our gym is equipped with 100+ advanced strength machines, free weights, and functional training tools to help you train smarter and lift better.

At XtraFit, we go beyond just lifting heavy. Our trainers teach proper form, progressive overload techniques, and workout periodization to ensure safe and effective strength gains. We tailor programs based on your body type, fitness level, and goals — whether you want to build lean muscle, tone your body, or increase raw power.

Strength training also improves bone density, enhances metabolism, and boosts energy levels. It helps reduce the risk of injury in daily life and improves posture and flexibility. For those looking to transform their physique, strength training is the most sustainable and long-term solution.

We offer guided group sessions, personal coaching, and app-based tracking to monitor your progress and keep you motivated. Plus, our recovery facilities like steam baths and massage chairs aid in faster muscle recovery and reduce soreness.

Strength isn’t just physical — it’s mental. Every lift builds confidence, resilience, and a stronger version of you. Join the XtraFit community and experience the difference strength training can make in your body and life.
