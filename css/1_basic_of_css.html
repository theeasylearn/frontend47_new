        <h1>From Homeless to Harvard</h1>
        <p>Liz Murray’s early life was marked by extreme poverty, neglect, and hardship. Her parents were drug addicts,
            and she often had no food or electricity at home. When her mother died of AIDS, Liz was just 15 years old
            and found herself homeless on the streets of New York. Despite these challenges, she remained determined to
            change her circumstances. She continued studying, often reading her textbooks in subway stations and on park
            benches.</p>
        <p>Liz eventually completed high school in just two years and won a scholarship to Harvard University. Her
            incredible transformation from homelessness to the halls of one of the world’s top universities shows how
            determination and belief in oneself can overcome even the most difficult circumstances. Today, Liz is a
            motivational speaker and author, using her story to inspire others to rise above their struggles and take
            charge of their future, no matter how bleak it may seem.</p>

        <h1>The Colonel Who Never Gave Up</h1>
        <p>Harland David Sanders, better known as Colonel Sanders, faced numerous failures throughout his life. He tried
            many careers—including steamboat pilot, insurance salesman, and railroad worker—before finally opening a
            small restaurant attached to a gas station. When he was 65, he received his first social security check and
            realized he needed to do more to survive. Armed with his fried chicken recipe, he went door-to-door to sell
            his idea to restaurants.</p>
        <p>After being rejected over 1,000 times, one restaurant finally accepted his offer, and KFC was born. Today,
            KFC is one of the biggest fast-food chains in the world. Colonel Sanders’ story proves that age and repeated
            failure are not roadblocks—they are stepping stones. His persistence reminds us that success often comes
            just after we’re ready to give up.</p>

        <h1>Blind but Unstoppable</h1>
        <p>Helen Keller lost both her sight and hearing at just 19 months old due to an illness. Her world became dark
            and silent, and she was unable to communicate with those around her. But her life took a dramatic turn when
            her teacher, Anne Sullivan, entered the scene. Through endless patience and groundbreaking techniques, Anne
            taught Helen how to communicate using finger spelling and eventually how to speak, read Braille, and even
            write.</p>
        <p>Helen Keller went on to graduate from college—becoming the first deaf-blind person in history to do so. She
            authored several books, traveled the world, and became a fierce advocate for the disabled. Her courage and
            unshakable willpower made her one of the most respected figures in history. Her story teaches us that
            limitations exist only when we let them define us.</p>

        <h1>The Runner with No Legs</h1>
        <p>Oscar Pistorius was born without fibulas in both legs and had them amputated below the knees when he was just
            11 months old. But instead of letting his disability define him, he chose to defy expectations. With the
            help of carbon-fiber prosthetic blades, he took up running and quickly gained recognition for his speed and
            strength. Nicknamed the "Blade Runner," Oscar competed in the Paralympics and even qualified for the 2012
            London Olympics against able-bodied athletes.</p>
        <p>Despite the controversies later in his life, Oscar’s athletic achievements are undeniable and inspirational.
            He proved to the world that physical limitations don’t determine potential. His journey symbolizes the power
            of mindset and determination. His story continues to motivate athletes and individuals around the world to
            dream big and never let their perceived shortcomings hold them back.</p>

        <h1>The Girl Who Silenced the World</h1>
        <p>In 1992, a 12-year-old girl named Severn Cullis-Suzuki stood before world leaders at the UN Earth Summit in
            Rio de Janeiro and delivered a speech that stunned the world into silence. She spoke passionately about the
            damage being done to the planet, and how it was affecting her generation’s future. Her words were not filled
            with politics, but with truth, emotion, and urgency—coming from a child who genuinely cared.</p>
        <p>Her speech, later titled “The Girl Who Silenced the World for Five Minutes,” became a global wake-up call.
            Severn continued her advocacy into adulthood, championing environmental causes and education. Her story
            reminds us that you don't have to be powerful or experienced to make a difference. Sometimes, the most
            powerful voices come from the youngest hearts, unfiltered and full of hope.</p>
